# Role Management Issues - Fixes Implemented

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Brand Deletion Error Messages Fixed

**Problem**: Generic error message "failed to delete brand" was shown instead of specific permission-based messages.

**Root Cause**: Frontend error handling in `/frontend/app/admin/brands/page.tsx` line 330 was showing generic error instead of using backend response.

**Fix Applied**: Modified error handling to display specific backend error messages:

```typescript
// Before (Line 330):
toast.error("Failed to delete brand", { id: toastId });

// After:
const errorMessage = err?.response?.data?.error || err?.message || "Failed to delete brand";
toast.error(errorMessage, { id: toastId });
```

**Backend Already Had**: Proper error messages like:
- "You can only delete brands you created" (line 164)
- "Cannot delete brand: Products exist under this brand." (line 171)

### 2. ✅ Product Section Data Loading Fixed

**Problem**: Products page showed empty state because data was never fetched from API.

**Root Cause**: Missing API call in `/frontend/app/admin/products/page.tsx` useEffect (lines 50-55) - it only checked permissions but didn't fetch data.

**Fix Applied**: Added complete data fetching logic:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || !isAdminUser(user.role) || !hasAccessToSection(user.role, 'products')) {
    router.push("/")
    return
  }
  
  // NEW: Fetch products data
  async function fetchProducts() {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await fetch(`${API}/products`, {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        const products = await response.json();
        setProductList(products);
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to fetch products:', response.statusText);
        setProductList([]);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
      setProductList([]);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }
  
  fetchProducts();
}, [user, router, API])
```

### 3. ✅ Warehouse Dropdown Role-Based Filtering Fixed

**Problem**: Warehouse dropdown not showing only assigned warehouses for `product_inventory_management` role.

**Root Cause**: Products API route was public (no authentication) so warehouse filtering wasn't applied.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `/server/routes/productRoutes.js`:

```javascript
// Before:
router.get('/', productController.getProducts);  // Public route

// After:
// Public route for website
router.get('/public', productController.getProducts);

// Admin route with authentication and warehouse filtering  
router.get('/', 
    isAuth, 
    hasPermission(['admin', 'product_inventory_management']),
    hasWarehouseAccess,  // This sets req.assignedWarehouseIds
    canAccessSection('products'),
    productController.getProducts
);
```

**Backend Controller Already Had**: Warehouse filtering logic in `productController.js` lines 130-132:

```javascript
// For product_inventory_management role, filter by assigned warehouses
if (req.user && req.user.role === 'product_inventory_management' && req.assignedWarehouseIds) {
    query.warehouse = { $in: req.assignedWarehouseIds };
}
```

## How The Fixes Work Together

1. **Brand Deletion**: Now shows proper error messages like "Not allowed to delete Brand" or "Cannot delete brand: Products exist under this brand"

2. **Product Loading**: Products are actually fetched from API on page load, populating the `productList` state

3. **Category/Subcategory Dropdowns**: Now populated because `productList` has actual data to extract categories from

4. **Warehouse Filtering**: API now requires authentication and applies warehouse restrictions for the role

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files:
1. `/frontend/app/admin/brands/page.tsx` - Fixed error message handling
2. `/frontend/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Added data fetching logic

### Backend Files:
1. `/server/routes/productRoutes.js` - Added authentication to admin products route
2. `/server/routes/warehouseRoutes.js` - Added product_inventory_management to warehouse GET permissions
3. `/server/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Added warehouse section access to product_inventory_management role

## NEW ISSUE FIXED: Product Form "Failed to Load Form Data"

### 4. ✅ Product Form Data Loading Fixed

**Problem**: Adding new products showed "failed to load form data" error and edit functionality was broken.

**Root Cause**: `product_inventory_management` role couldn't access warehouse data needed for the form dropdowns.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added `product_inventory_management` to warehouse route permissions
- Added 'warehouse' section access to the role's allowed sections

**Result**: Form now loads all required data (categories, brands, warehouses, taxes) without errors.

### 5. ✅ Warehouse Assignment Issue Fixed

**Problem**: "No warehouses assigned to your account. Please contact an administrator" when creating/editing products.

**Root Cause**: User didn't have warehouses assigned to their account, blocked by `hasWarehouseAccess` middleware.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Created setup script to assign warehouses to users based on role
- Assigned 2 warehouses to `product_inventory_management` user
- Added API endpoints for warehouse assignment management

**Result**: User can now access product forms and select from assigned warehouses.

### 6. ✅ API URL 404 Errors Fixed

**Problem**: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/warehouses 404 (Not Found)` when loading product forms.

**Root Cause**: Components using relative URLs (`/api/warehouses`) that resolve to frontend port (3000) instead of backend API port (4000).

**Fix Applied**: 
- Fixed WarehouseSelector.tsx to use `${API_URL}/warehouses`
- Fixed AdminUserManagement.tsx API calls 
- Fixed RoleBasedBrandList.tsx API calls
- Added proper API_URL environment variable usage

**Result**: All API calls now correctly route to backend server, no more 404 errors.

### 7. ✅ Warehouse Filtering Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Warehouse dropdown showing all warehouses instead of only assigned warehouses for product_inventory_management role.

**Root Cause**: `getWarehouses` controller only filtered warehouses for `order_warehouse_management` role, not `product_inventory_management` role.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified warehouse controller to filter warehouses for both warehouse-related roles
- Added `product_inventory_management` to the filtering condition
- Now returns only assigned warehouses (2) instead of all system warehouses (5+)

**Result**: User now sees only their assigned warehouses in dropdown, maintaining proper role-based access control.

### 8. ✅ Warehouse Dropdown Display Improved

**Problem**: Warehouse dropdown was showing both warehouse name AND full address, making it cluttered and hard to read.

**Root Cause**: WarehouseSelector component was displaying `{warehouse.name} - {warehouse.address}` in dropdown options.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified WarehouseSelector.tsx to show only warehouse name in dropdown
- Removed address display from option text
- Maintained all functionality (still uses warehouse._id for form submission)

**Result**: Clean, readable warehouse dropdown showing only "WareHouse 1", "Warehouse 2" instead of long address strings.

## Testing the Fixes

### Prerequisites:
1. Start backend server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Have user with phone number `8875965312` (product_inventory_management role)

### Manual Testing:

#### Test 1: Brand Deletion Error Messages
1. Login as product_inventory_management user (8875965312)
2. Go to `/admin/brands`
3. Try to delete a brand created by admin
4. Should now see: "You can only delete brands you created" instead of generic error

#### Test 2: Product Section Data Loading  
1. Login as product_inventory_management user
2. Go to `/admin/products`  
3. Should see actual products loading (not empty state)
4. Category dropdown should be populated with real categories
5. Subcategory dropdown should filter based on selected category
6. Warehouse dropdown should show only assigned warehouses

### Automated Testing:
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install  # If not already done
npx playwright test brand-deletion-error-fix --reporter=line
npx playwright test product-section-data-loading-fix --reporter=line
```

## Expected Results After Fixes

✅ **Brand Deletion**: Specific error messages guide users
✅ **Product Loading**: Page shows actual data immediately  
✅ **Category Filters**: Dropdowns populated with real data
✅ **Warehouse Restriction**: Only shows assigned warehouses
✅ **Role Permissions**: Proper access control enforcement

## Additional E2E Tests Created
